# Welcome to Stock Trader App

Using this website, I have demonstrated the required functionalities, which are :
- searching for a stock
- buy and sell a stock and also store the price in the database
- show all the transactions in the portfolio section

## Tech stack used :
- **Frontend** - React (Javascript)
- **Backend** - Flask (Python)
- **Database** - PostgreSQL
- **UI** - Tailwind CSS

## Steps to setup the project locally :
- extract the zip file
- download and install PostgreSQL and replace the credentials(username and password) in the `app.py` file.
- create a database with the name specified in the `app.py` file, and the code to create the table is already included in the `app.py` file.	
 - in the root directory of the project run `python app.py` for the backend, if we get any errors regarding non-availability of packages, you can install those using `pip install`.
- cd into the frontend folder and run `npm install` to install all the necessary modules, and then run the application using `npm run dev`.
