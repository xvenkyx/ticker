# 🚀 Challenge: SellScaleHood Financial App!

**We are going to be building a simple version of Robinhood (web client).** This is going to require setting up a basic backend server, frontend application, and some sort of data storage (database or file storage are both acceptable).

**The app is expected to be able to do three things:**

1. “Query” for specific stock tickers (i.e. search for $AAPL, $TSLA). Powered by [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) library
2. “Buy” and “Sell” specific stock tickers (i.e. enter ticker, quantity, and save the amount somewhere in a database)
3. “View Portfolio” and see a list of all previously bought stock tickers.

**In order to build these, we are expecting three core pieces:**

1. A REST API built using Flask Python SDK. Build necessary endpoints to complete challenge
2. A React JS frontend application to interact with application (use Typescript if possible!)
3. Some sort of database of your choice (PSQL, file storage, mongoDB, firebase, etc)

The ideal deliverable will be simple, elegant, and functional. Bonus points if it looks nice with a cool design!
